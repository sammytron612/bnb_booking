# PaymentController Security Fixes Applied
*Date: September 22, 2025*

## ✅ **CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### 🔒 **1. Route Protection - FIXED**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Implementation**: Added `signed` middleware to all payment routes
- **Protection**: Routes now require valid signed URLs with expiration
- **Impact**: Prevents direct access enumeration attacks

```php
// NEW SECURED ROUTES:
Route::get('/payment/checkout/{booking}', [PaymentController::class, 'createCheckoutSession'])
    ->middleware('signed')->name('payment.checkout');
Route::get('/payment/success/{booking}', [PaymentController::class, 'paymentSuccess'])
    ->middleware('signed')->name('payment.success');
Route::get('/payment/cancel/{booking}', [PaymentController::class, 'paymentCancel'])
    ->middleware('signed')->name('payment.cancel');
```

### 🔒 **2. Booking Access Validation - FIXED**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Implementation**: Added `validateBookingAccess()` method
- **Protection**: Validates signed URL signatures and logs security events
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to booking payment flows

### 🔒 **3. Stripe API Key Security - FIXED**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Implementation**: Moved API key initialization to per-method calls
- **Protection**: Reduces exposure surface of sensitive credentials
- **Method**: `setStripeKey()` called only when needed

### 🔒 **4. Enhanced Payment Verification - FIXED**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive payment validation
- **Protection**: Verifies amount, booking ID, currency, and payment status
- **Method**: `verifyStripePayment()` with multiple validation layers

### 🔒 **5. Email Hijacking Prevention - FIXED**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Implementation**: Added email change validation
- **Protection**: Prevents confirmation emails being redirected to attackers
- **Method**: `validateEmailChange()` with domain trust validation

### 🔒 **6. Webhook Security Hardening - FIXED**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Implementation**: Added rate limiting and enhanced logging
- **Protection**: Prevents webhook flooding and improves monitoring
- **Features**: IP logging, user agent tracking, content length validation

## 🔄 **NEW SECURITY WORKFLOW**

### 1. **Booking Creation**
1. User fills booking form
2. System generates signed URL (24-hour expiration)
3. User redirected to secure payment checkout

### 2. **Payment Processing**
1. Signed URL validated before access
2. Booking ownership verified
3. Stripe session created with metadata validation
4. Payment processed with enhanced verification

### 3. **Payment Completion**
1. Success/cancel pages validate signed URLs
2. Payment details verified against booking
3. Email changes validated before processing
4. Security events logged
